# Overview

"Prayer Buddy" is an app that is intended to be a place to record the impressions that come to you during prayer. Since faith is when we take action on the commandments that we come to know are truth, this app helps us to take action on the impressions that come to us. 

"Prayer Buddy" in essense is a to do list, so it operates on two main screens. The List View and the Edit View. It requires stored data in a model to remember the data that is inputted into the application

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

- Xcode 14 - IDE (requires Mac or VM)
- SwiftUI - Used to position and create the Views.
- Core Data - A means for building a model that can be referenced within the vie

# Future Work

* Send notifications when it is time to take action on an impression/action item.
* Create a feature that allows you to reschedule promptings.
* Create a journaling view. That allows to have a daily record of thoughts (Note taking section)
* Calendar view that allows you to tap on a calendar day to see what thoughts and promptings came to the person praying on that day.
